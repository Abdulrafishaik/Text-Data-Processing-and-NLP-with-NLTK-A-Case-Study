Overview: In this project, I applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze textual data using Python and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). I worked with five text files and performed several essential text preprocessing tasks, such as handling contractions, removing punctuation, digits, and stopwords, followed by tokenization, stemming, and data visualization. The goal was to clean and prepare the text for further analysis and to extract meaningful insights from the data.

Key Steps Involved:

Data Collection:

Imported five text files containing raw text data for analysis.
Text Preprocessing:

Handling Contractions: Used the contractions library to expand contractions (e.g., "can't" → "cannot") for consistency.
Removing Punctuation and Digits: Cleaned text by eliminating punctuation marks and digits using Python's string module.
Tokenization: Applied word_tokenize() from NLTK to split the text into individual words (tokens).
Stopwords Removal: Removed common stopwords (e.g., "and," "the," "is") using NLTK's stopword list, ensuring that the analysis focused on meaningful words.
Text Normalization:

Stemming: Performed stemming using NLTK's PorterStemmer to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" → "run").
Data Analysis:

Word Frequency Analysis: Calculated the frequency of each word in the cleaned text data.
Data Visualization:

Word Cloud: Visualized the most frequent words using the WordCloud library to highlight key patterns and trends in the dataset.
Tools & Libraries Used:

Python: For data processing and analysis
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks (tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming)
Pandas & Numpy: For handling data and numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
WordCloud: For visualizing word frequency distributions
Outcome:

Cleaned and preprocessed text data, enabling more effective analysis and insights.
Generated a word cloud to visually represent the most frequent terms.
This project enhanced my skills in text data processing and NLP techniques, showcasing my ability to handle and analyze unstructured text data using Python. It also provided valuable insights into how text cleaning and preparation impact subsequent data analysis and machine learning models.
